MiST Engine 1.0.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2010-05-30 Eugene Shatokhin  <spectre@ispras.ru>
    * Added support for CMake-based build and install process. The support for Autotools-based builds can be dropped in some future version.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MiST Engine 1.0.0 final
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2010-02-01 Eugene Shatokhin  <spectre@ispras.ru>
    * doc: prepared MiST Engine manual.

2010-01-24 Eugene Shatokhin  <spectre@ispras.ru>
    * mist_base.c: fixed: wrong error was reported if at least one of PH_*_MARKER parameters was given an empty value in the .cfg file for a template group.
    * mist_engine.c: fixed: the functions now check the parameters like names and markers for emptiness.
    * mist_engine.h.in: minor changes in the comments: "attribute" => "parameter", etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MiST Engine 1.0.0 beta 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2010-01-17 Eugene Shatokhin  <spectre@ispras.ru>
    * mist_base.c: fixed: no error was reported if FILE_PATH_TEMPLATE parameter was present in the .cfg file for a template group but had empty value.
    * mist_base.c: fixed: conditional constructs were evaluated incorrectly in some cases if the conditional expression had multiple values and the number of values of the branches differed between the branches.
    * mist_base.c: added support for concat-expressions in conditions: <$if concat(TA)$>...<$endif$>.
    * smap.c: fixed: a special comparator is now used for sorting the array of string pairs: it is similar to the one used for lookup but it ensures that the order of the elements with the same keys is preserved.
    * mist_string_utils: rewrote mist_name_is_bad(): a smaller range of allowed characters will be supported from now on.

2010-01-11 Eugene Shatokhin  <spectre@ispras.ru>
    * Updated dates in copyright notices.
    
    * mist_string_utils.c: fixed checking for invalid names (mist_name_is_bad()) to properly handle both signed and unsigned char types.
    * mist_string_utils.c, mist_string_utils.h: fixed: comma was not included in the list of characters not allowed in the names of templates, etc. (mist_name_is_bad()).
    * mist_base.h: cosmetic corrections in the comments (misprints, etc.).
    * mist_base.c: fixed: it was not checked in several cases whether the name of the template group and the names the templates are valid.
    * mist_base.c: fixed: absence of main template of a group was not handled properly (there was just an assert() call).

MiST Engine 1.0.0 beta 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2009-12-14 Eugene Shatokhin  <spectre@ispras.ru>
    * Minor fixes in the description of the tool.
    * Prepared a brief README.

2009-11-21 Eugene Shatokhin  <spectre@ispras.ru>
    * mist_string_utils.c: fixed: assertion on 'ptr' was too strict in mist_line_num_for_ptr(): 'ptr' may point just after the end of the data being parsed.

2009-11-08 Eugene Shatokhin  <spectre@ispras.ru>
    * mist_base.c: mist_is_range_valid() is now defined in debug mode only.
    * mist_file_utils.c: fixed: missing name of a parameter in a .cfg file was not checked for and was not reported as an error.
    
    * The first version mist_engine application is now complete.
    * doc: Man page for mist_engine application is prepared.

2009-10-29  Eugene Shatokhin  <spectre@ispras.ru>
    * Added linker export map (versions.ldscript). Public MiST interfaces are assigned version MIST_1.0 there. Here, "1" is the major version of the library, "0" is its minor version.
    * Implemented build, clean, install and uninstall procedures (Linux, Windows with MinGW and MSYS) in Makefile.am files, configure.ac, etc. Currently only GCC compilers are supported (version 4.x or newer, but 3.x will also do, however the code generated by GCC 3.x may be less optimized due to the lack of -fvisibility option). 
    
2009-10-18  Eugene Shatokhin  <spectre@ispras.ru>
    * Added the common source files from T2C, provided wrappers around mist_*_impl-functions to implement public MiST API, implemented internal versioning.
