KEDR Framework
--------------
KEDR framework provides the tools for runtime analysis (especially, 
verification) of Linux kernel modules, including kernel-mode drivers. 

The tools provided by KEDR operate on a module chosen by the user (target 
module). They monitor kernel function calls made by the module, perform 
fault simulation, etc. This may complement many existing tools for error 
detection, fault simulation, memory checking, etc., that usually operate 
on the Linux kernel as a whole.

The typical usage of KEDR is essentially as follows. The user works with 
the target module as usual or probably runs some specific tests on it. At 
the same time, KEDR tools are monitoring the operation of the module, 
checking if it works correctly, doing fault simulation if requested, 
dumping the data about the actions made by the driver to some kind of a 
trace for future analysis, etc. 

Currently, KEDR works on x86 and x86-64 architectures. 

KEDR is free software and is distributed under the terms of GNU General
