KEDR 0.5

The most significant changes:
    * KEDR now works on the kernel versions 3.10 - 3.15 (as of -rc4) too.
    * It is now possible to make LeakCheck show the current set of allocated
but not freed blocks at any time as well as discard the collected data (if
requested).
    * LeakCheck now also shows information about the processes that allocated
the leaked memory blocks.
    * Call stack is now output for each simulated failure to simplify the
analysis.
    * Many fixes in LeakCheck and Fault Simulation subsystem.

See ChangeLog for detailed information about the changes in this version.

KEDR 0.4.1

The most significant enhancement in this version is the support for kernel
versions 3.7 and 3.8. Several bug fixes have also been made.

See ChangeLog for detailed information about the changes in this version.

KEDR 0.4

The most significant changes:
    * KEDR now works on the kernel versions 3.3-3.6 too.
    * LeakCheck has been redesigned: the analysis engine has been separated 
from data collection which makes the tool easier to maintain and extend. 
The API it provides allows to use the memory leak detector in more cases 
than before.
    * Handling of the information about signatures of the processed 
functions has been revisited to remove duplicate code and make the 
components involved easier to configure and maintain.
    * 12 more functions that allocate or deallocate memory are now 
processed, so are the functions kfree_rcu() expands to.
    * Many fixes have been made in LeakCheck, fault simulation and other 
subsystems. 
    * Support for kernel version 2.6.31 has been dropped. The minimum 
supported kernel version is now 2.6.32.

See ChangeLog for detailed information about the changes in this version.

KEDR 0.3

This release provides several enhancements and various fixes compared 
to version 0.2.1. The most significant changes:
    * Handling of intercepted function calls has been revisited to allow 
doing several kinds of analysis at the same time (e.g. performing fault 
simulation and memory leak detection simultaneously).
    * The components responsible for fault simulation are now decoupled 
from call monitoring (call tracing) facilities and can be used 
independently if necessary.
    * Several enhancements and fixes have been applied to the trace 
capturing utility.
    * Stack trace-related API has been revisited and simplified. If the 
kernel provides reliable stack traces, the API works now even if 
save_stack_trace() is not available.
    * Handling of allocations and frees in the memory leak detector is now 
deferred via a work queue. This allows to significantly reduce the time 
spent with locks held.

See ChangeLog for detailed information about the changes in this version.

KEDR 0.2.1

The most significant change in this release is the enhancement of build 
system. It is now possible to build KEDR for a kernel different from the
one running on the build machine. It is also possible to build it for a 
different system (e.g. for Chromium OS, x86-generic). 

The usage instructions are available in KEDR Wiki:
http://openfacts2.berlios.de/wikien/index.php/BerliosProject:KEDR

See ChangeLog for detailed information about the changes in this version.

KEDR 0.2

This release provides several enhancements and various fixes compared 
to version 0.1. The most significant changes:
    * Tracing subsystem has been completely rewritten to be more versatile 
and reliable even on SMP systems.
    * A memory leak detector (LeakCheck) has been implemented.
    * It is now possible to restrict fault simulation to particular areas 
in the target module (if the kernel provides reliable stack traces).
    * Several fixes have been made for KEDR to be able to work on the 
versions 2.6.37 and 2.6.38 of the kernel.
    * Call monitoring for 20 more functions is now supported. Support for 
fault simulation for many of these functions as well as for vmalloc() group
has also been provided.
    * The issues concerning parallel builds (bug #017731) have been fixed.

See ChangeLog for detailed information about the changes in this version.

KEDR 0.1

This is the first public stable version of KEDR framework. 
Main features of this version:
    * support for call monitoring for the kernel modules;
    * support for fault simulation according to the scenarios chosen by 
the user;
    * the means to customize the analysis tools provided with KEDR and 
to build new tools on top of it.
